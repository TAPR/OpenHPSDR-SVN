The utility blocks are some hierarchial and python
utilities. Place these files in ~/.grc_gnuradio folder
(normally hidden) to make them availabile under
Gnuradio 3.7.2.

The blocks available:

Static Phase shifter - allows shifting the pahse of a signal by
a constant amount from -Pi to +Pi.

Fast autocorrelation. Provides a fast executing autocorrelation
algorithm that you can display on a time-domain trace.

CWKeyboard. This emits CW from a text string. Right now there
is no text buffering. You need to wiat for the current line to 
complete sending before entering new text. The CW speed must be
8 WPM or faster.

chirpsource - genrateds a linearly-chirped signal between
-samp_rate/2 and +samp_rate/2 with selectable direction.

NOTE:

You must hand edit the path in the .XML file to point to
the location on disk where your .grc_gnuradio diretory is
located. I've tried ~/ but it doesn't work -- the path needs
to be something like /home/tom/.grc_gnuradio/exectuable name
