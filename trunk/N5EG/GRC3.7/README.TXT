README.TXT   November 19, 2012    Tom McDermott, N5EG


The SVN repository  ./trunk/N5EG contains the gnuradio module for Hermes/Metis.

Right now, gnuradio only runs on linux. As far as I know, there is no windows
or Mac version available.

Gnuradio is structured to deploy modules by building from source, there is no
way that I know to distribute just a binary (but I'm not an expert).

The document "How to build Gnuradio Hermes-Metis.pdf" describes how do do the build.

The directory gr-hpsdr must be held intact, but you can put it where ever you
would like on your system.

The directory grc_applications contains some samples to show how to use the 
HermesNB module in Gnu Radio Companion (GRC) the gui front end for gnuradio.
