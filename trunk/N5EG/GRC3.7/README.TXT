The SVN repository  ./trunk/N5EG/GRC3.7/gr-hpsdr contains the gnuradio module for Hermes/Metis for GRC Version 3.7.

The GRC3.7 branch only works with GRC3.7.  
The SVN repository  ./trunk/N5EG/GRC3.6 contains the gnuradio module for
Hermes/Metis for GRC Version 3.6 (tested up through 3.6.5).

Some of the GRC3.7 GUIs operate differently than they did in GRC3.6


Right now, gnuradio runs on linux. There is a version that bulds on MAC using
Macports. It has also been built on Windows, but appears to be difficult.

Gnuradio is structured to deploy modules by building from source.

The document "How to build Gnuradio Hermes-Metis.pdf" describes how do do the build.

The directory gr-hpsdr must be held intact, but you can put it where ever you
would like on your system.

The directory grc_applications contains some samples to show how to use the 
HermesNB module in Gnu Radio Companion (GRC) the gui front end for gnuradio.
