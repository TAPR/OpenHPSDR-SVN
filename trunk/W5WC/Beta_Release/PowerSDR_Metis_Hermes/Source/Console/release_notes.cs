//
//	Bug Fixes:
//
//		Issue:			TUN in AM/SAM/FMN is 11kHz off frequency.
//		Fix:			This issue was caused by the 11kHz IF when in these modes.
//						We have adjusted the tone to adjust for this IF.
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN:			642
//
//		Issue:			Squelch transitions sound rough.
//		Fix:			There was a bug in the transition routine that was causing
//						the ramp to do strange things.  This has been addressed.
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO, N4HY
//		SVN:			633
//
//		Issue:			Panadapter transmit display is affected by the preamp
//						setting.
//		Fix:			The preamp offset was being used by the display routine
//						regardless of MOX mode.  This has been addressed and
//						the transmit data line should no longer be affected by
//						preamp setting.
//		Reported by:	W4TME
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN:			574
//
//		Issue:			Hover tuning is sometimes off on VFO B.
//		Fix:			A typo error was causing this problem.  The hover
//						tuning for VFO B now works correctly like VFO A.
//		Reported by:	K6JCA
//		Fixed By:		K6JCA
//		SVN:			573
//
//		Issue:			Spur reduction is always off after MOX.
//		Fix:			In the refactoring of the MOX handler, some code was
//						left out to put the spur reduction in the right state.
//						This has been addressed.
//		Reported by:	NO2T, K6JCA
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN:			571
//
//		Issue:			Click tuning a signal in DIGL mode always causes the
//						signal to be centered in the filter passband regardless
//						of the DIGL click tuning offset.
//		Fix:			There was an error that caused the click tuning
//						algorithm to think that the offset was always outside
//						of the selected filter.  This has been fixed.
//		Reported by:	N2UO
//		Fixed By:		K6JCA
//		SVN:			559
//
//		Issue:			Keyspan USB Serial Adapter's can't be selected in com port selections.										
//		Fix:			The Keyspan adapter returns FILE_TYPE_UNKNOWN on a GetFileType call so 
//                      we now allow that filetype in the serial port opening code (SerialPort)
//		Reported by:	N4DWK (5/29/2006 on Flex-Radio list)

//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		650
//
//		Feature:		Numerous new appearance controls.
//		Change:			In order to allow complete customization of the console, we have added
//						many more color controls to the appearance menu in the Setup Form.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		650
//
//		Feature:		SWR Protection revised.
//		Change:			The SWR protection now has a fold-back type of setup that will allow
//						recovery without having to return to receive mode.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		649
//
//		Feature:		Small last 3 digits on VFO.
//		Change:			We have added an option to allow the last 3 digits of each VFO to be
//						in a smaller font for easier readability.
//		Coded By:		K6JCA, KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		647
//
//		Feature:		PA Calibration routine now uses nominal values.
//		Change:			The cal routine uses 100W on all bands except 10 and 12m where it uses
//						75W.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		641
//
//		Feature:		Display code cleanup.
//		Change:			We have done a major league cleanup of the display code and associated
//						routines.  This has resulted in a significant performance increase even
//						with the larger display.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		595
//
//		Feature:		SWR selection now possible anytime.
//		Change:			SWR mode is now selectable at any time.  It will display "in TUN only"
//						when it is selected in TX mode outside of TUN.  This is another mod
//						thanks to K6JCA.
//		Coded By:		K6JCA
//		SVN Rev:		587
//
//		Feature:		Improved transition handling.
//		Change:			We changed some mechanics of how we transition from RX to TX and back
//						in order to prevent popping and hiss.  The result is a much cleaner
//						transition.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO, N4HY
//		SVN Rev:		581
//
//		Feature:		New Tuning Step Rates.
//		Change:			This is the first of many interface features we intend
//						to improve thanks to K6JCA and his modifications.
//		Coded By:		K6JCA
//		SVN Rev:		569
//
//		Feature:		Console/Display Redesigned.
//		Change:			The console has been made larger.  It was designed to
//						fit within a 1024x768 or higher resolution.  The
//						display has been extended to match the new layout. We have also
//						moved to more sliders vs. the up/down controls.  Other changes
//						include graphical controls for setting Squelch (SQL), the noise
//						gate, and VOX.
//		Coded By:		K6JCA, KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		572
//
//		Feature:		TX Meter SWR option always available.
//		Change:			The SWR option can now be selected outside of TUN mode.
//						While transmitting outside of TUN mode, it will display
//						"in TUN only".
//		Coded By:		K6JCA
//		SVN Rev:		587
//
//	New Features:
//
//		Feature:		Sub Receiver.
//		Description:	We have talked about it for a long time and have finally implemented
//						a second receiver within the passband.  Use VFO to control the
//						frequency.  For now the mode and filter are shared (locked) between
//						the two VFOs.  Credit goes to Frank AB2KT and Bob N4HY for having this
//						in the DSP long before we got it into the interface.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		683
//
//		Feature:		Edge style multimeter.
//		Description:	Again, big thanks to Jeff, K6JCA, the user can now select between
//						the original or Edge style multimeter displays.
//		Coded By:		K6JCA, KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		669
//
//		Feature:		Panadapter Zoom and Pan controls.
//		Description:	Thanks to Jeff, K6JCA, the user can now adjust the bandwidth
//						of the display.  When zoomed in tight, you can pan to see the
//						entire spectrum.  We all owe Jeff a huge thanks for implementing
//						this in his console (and sharing his source with us).
//		Coded By:		K6JCA, KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		665
//
//		Feature:		Mode specific control area.
//		Description:	To ease operation, we have a new area on our console that is
//						dedicated to the specific mode currently in use.  This should
//						keep the user from having to reference controls on the Setup
//						Form too often.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		625
//
//		Feature:		Edirol FA-66 Support.
//		Description:	The new 192kHz FA-66 supported soundcard made by Edirol is
//						now supported.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		621
//
//		Feature:		Wave File Gain.
//		Description:	In an effort to make wave files easier to play over the air,
//						we have added a gain control that is used whenever the user
//						transmits while playback is active.  This helps keep the
//						microphone gain in a reasonable range while allowing the wave
//						file to play at an adaquate power level.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		659
//
//		Feature:		Custom Filter Setup.
//		Description:	We have added a complete interface that allows the user to
//						setup all of the receiver filters for each mode.  Right click
//						on the filter area and select "Configure..." to see this new
//						feature.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		601
//
//		Feature:		Whole filter drag'n'drop.
//		Description:	To complement the ability to drag the filter edges, you can
//						now grab the whole filter and slide it around.  The cursor
//						will change to indicate which drag mode it is in.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		596
//
//		Feature:		Filter Width Modes.
//		Description:	We have added Filter Width Slider Modes to allow Linear
//						as well as Log mappings for the width slider.  These
//						new options are available on the Setup Form->General
//						Tab->Options SubTab.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		528
//
//		Feature:		FireBox Mixer Bug Workaround.
//		Description:	With the FireBox beta firmware, there is a bug that
//						causes the input to bleed into the output until the
//						FireBox mixer is launched.  To combat this issue, when
//						the FireBox is selected (and physically detected), the
//						software will briefly launch the FireBox mixer and then
//						close it.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		586
//
//		Feature:		Enable Keyboard Shortcuts control added.
//		Description:	Due to popular demand, we have added a checkbox that
//						will enable/disable all keyboard shortcuts.  This can
//						be unchecked to prevent keystrokes intended for a
//						logger or other application from causing unintended
//						results.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO

//
//	Bug Fixes:
//
//		Issue:			Zero beating an AM signal with an asymmetrical filter
//						results in the carrier being at the wrong place.
//		Fix:			We have adjusted the zero beat function to be mode
//						specific.  SSB and CW use the CW pitch while the DIGx
//						modes use their click tune offsets as defined in the
//						Setup Form.  All of these modes will zero beat to the 
//						middle of the filter if the pitch is not within the
//						passband of the filter.  For AM/SAM/FMN modes, the
//						carrier is always zero beated to the carrier regardless
//						of the filter selection.
//		Reported by:	KC2LFI, BugID# 360
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN:			555
//
//		Issue:			Display is not updated when changing sample rates in

//						sample rate in this mode.
//		Reported by:	VK6APH, BugID# 359
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN:			554
//
//		Issue:			Display during CW Transmit is unpredictable.
//		Fix:			In CW, the display should now do the following:  In 
//						Panadapter mode, it will have the usual display less
//						the filter.  In all other modes, it will display as in
//						receive mode without a dataline.
//		Reported by:	VE6IV, BugID# 349
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO

//						deciding what do to when the VAC stereo checkbox
//						state was changed.
//		Reported by:	N6SF,  BugID 345
//		Fixed By:		N4HY
//		SVN:			534
//
//		Issue:			6m output low if PA is present.
//		Fix:			The PA TR relay was being put in the wrong state for
//						this mode and was preventing RF from passing through
//						the PA.  This has been revolved.
//		Reported By:	KL7JDR, K9FOH
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN:			525
//
//		Issue:			VAC Latency.
//		Fix:			The VAC ring buffers had the same mechanisms in them for
//						adding zero padding at the beginning of the ring buffers
//						rather than allowing the minimum amount required by the
//						callbacks.
//		Reported By:	N4HY, W4TME
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//		SVN:			521
//
//		Issue:			CW Latency.
//		Fix:			Not since we first built the keyer had we done anything
//						other than optimize the audio class and cw class structures
//						for handling callbacks and ring buffer manipulations. We
//						had not looked at the console and its MOX/PTT/etc. functions.
//						The same poorly designed MOX code has been holding up the
//						switching since the first day.  We have reduced the switch
//						time significantly and deleted ALL delay in the CW ring
//						buffer filling code. All the needed delay is in the IF/Audio
//						ring buffers already.
//		Reported By:	N4HY, VE6IV, KE5DTO
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO, N4HY
//		SVN Rev:		520
//						
//		Issue:			TUN is reversed.
//		Fix:			When we fixed the "TUN is always USB" issue, we made a
//						mistake that caused TUN to always be on the wrong
//						sideband.  This has been corrected.
//		Reported By:	K6JCA
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		512
//
//		Issue:			CW Ring Buffer protection.
//		Fix:			When we moved the CW Ring Buffer resets to the callback
//						we mistakenly assumed that all instances of overwrites
//						were eliminated.  The critical sections were removed.
//						It is POSSIBLE this was mistaken.  They have been
//						reintroduced to see if the offset l/r buffers are fixed
//						as a result.  CW Ring reset size modified to be a bit longer
//						than the audio buffer.  PollPTT period decreased to help
//						shorten the time between key closure and RF generation.
//						In addition,  critical sections have been replaced with
//						critical sections and spin locks.  We have also added
//						critical section protection to the ring buffers used in
//						exchange of samples for VAC.  Clean Up of the VAC
//						initialization also done.

//						was disabled.
//		Reported By:	W3DUQ
//		Fixed By:		N4HY
//		SVN Rev:		482
//
//		Issue:			Frequency Calibration changes the filter.
//		Fix:			The frequency calibration now saves the filter before
//						changing it and restores it once the calibration has
//						been completed.
//		Reported By:	W5SXD
//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//		SVN Rev:		470

//		Issue:			Variable filters sometimes forget the last setting.
//		Fix:			The variable filters are designed to remember their
//						settings independantly by mode for both filters (Var1 &
//						Var2).  The Filter Shift slider was affecting this
//						behavior when it was offset from 0 (center).  This was
//						due to a decision made to store the original variable
//						filters rather than the shifted values when using the
//						shift control.  From now on, adjusting the variable

//						the Shift slider being automatically centered.

//		Issue:			Level calibration is not accurate.
//		Fix:			We rewrote the level calibration routine and it now

//						and 10 samples to average the display correction.  This
//						results in a much more consistant and accurate
//						calibration across all preamp modes for both the
//						display and the RX Meter.  Because of the extra
//						samples, the routine is slightly slower.  For this
//						reason we have added a progress meter to the level

//		Issue:			When AVG is on, the RX<->TX transitions are slower.
//		Fix:			This problem was caused by processing the silenced
//						buffers that go through the DSP while in the transition

//		Issue:			With VAC Auto Enable on, switching from DIGU to CWU

//	Bug Fixes:
//
//		Issue:			"Binaural / DSB appears"
//		Fix:			Upon MOX, PTT, key press and/or release and at random
//						times, the console would go into what appears at
//						first glance to be binaural in SSB/RX and DSB on
//						TX.  A poorly understood condition happens when we
//						reset the ring buffers in the DSP in the MOX handler.
//						This reset was supposedly protected by the update
//						semaphore. Its job is to prevent changes of state
//						while the DSP is operating on a buffer of samples.
//						It should only allow changes to occur when the DSP
//						is idle.  Some condition causes this process to
//						hang on for too long.  We have implemented the
//						obvious fix which is to do the ring buffer
//						manipulations at this level only in the callback
//						and is implemented by a flag.  Since the developers
//						could not get the PTT to make this condition,  we
//						leave it to the users to tell us if it is fixed.

//		Fixed By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			BIN does not work in AM/SAM/FM modes.
//		Fix:			This is not really a bug, but more of a consequence
//						that the demodulated audio is already a real audio
//						signal as opposed to a complex I/Q signal.  Therefore,

//		Issue:			Major source of instability repaired.
//		Fix:			In the audio callback processing class there were
//						several variables accessed from the console class.  In

//						each variable uses .NET memory management, access to
//						these variables within the callback proved to be

//  Modifications:

//		Feature:		Receive AGC slope implemented.
//		Change:			The slope calculation has been included in the agc code.
//						If a signal computes that it needs 50 dB of gain, the

//
//		Feature:		Receive AGC hang threshold implemented.
//		Change:			The receive agc now has hang threshold implemented. If the
//						received signal is below the hang threshold,  hang will not

//						in the last series of releases (since 1.4.5 started),
//						the output power for inputs which are being overdriven
//						will be attenuated.  As a reminder, on SSB, you will

//v1.4.5 Beta Preview 2 Released 10/28/05
//
//	Bug Fixes:
//
//		Issue:			Leveler does not work as intended.
//		Fix:			The Leveler is a piece of code intended to level out
//						audio presented from the microphone to the sound system
//						and the DSP on transmit.  The Leveler had two major
//						problems.  The first was ALC settings accidentally
//						being used in the leveler.  The second was due to
//						a unique condition in the leveler.  It has minimum
//						gain 1.0 or 0 dB.  It is intended to raise the audio
//						level in the case the distance or angle from your
//						mouth to the microphone changes.  Its default setting
//						is 10 dB max gain and should be increased only with
//						care as it will increase the background noise.
//						HINT: Use the noise gate.
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//
//		Issue:			Compander has distortion and can act as a limiter.
//		Fix:			Compander was accidentally initialized as an expander,
//						not a compressor.  The default setting is now correct
//						and the default performance is much better
//		Reported By:	N4HY
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//
//		Issue:			Transmit ALC setting wrong.
//		Fix:			The Transmitter ALC had its minimum gain, which set the
//						negative gain it would apply, being set by the Leveler
//						setting.  The ALC minimum gain setting had no effect.
//		Reported By:	Many
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//
//		Issue:			Integrated ATU performance is spotty at best.
//		Fix:			There was a problem in the hardware code that was
//						causing the ATU to get bypassed immediately following
//						a good tune sequence.  This has been corrected and the
//						ATU is now working properly for the first time since
//						we began installing them.  This hardware change may
//						also fix several other issues.  We are looking into
//						this and will confirm in future versions once testing
//						has been completed.

//
//		Issue:			VOX and footswitch do not work well together.
//		Fix:			If using VOX with a footswitch (or any other automatic
//						transmit mode), the console would switch rapidly from
//						receive to transmit and back.  We have corrected this
//						and now VOX cooperates with the other PTT modes
//						properly.
//		Reported By:	AH6JR
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			Enabling CAT on a non-existant COM port causes the
//						console to crash.
//		Fix:			This was due to poor exception handling.  The driver
//						was throwing the correct exception, but the level above
//						was not handling things correctly.  A fix is in place
//						to keep the console from crashing in this situation.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			Image Reject Algorithm sometimes fails.
//		Fix:			There were cases where the current filter setting was
//						too narrow to catch the image signal when running the
//						Image Reject Calibration.  The filter is now set to
//						6kHz automatically during the calibration and then
//						returned to the previous setting when finished.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			Importing Database causes band errors on 80 and 160m.
//		Fix:			Due to the way the import algorithm tries to
//						incorporate any user changes to the BandText table,
//						some default entries from previous versions were
//						conflicting with the newer entries.  This has been
//						addressed and importing should no longer be a problem.

//		Issue:			Display Peak will not work if AVG is on.
//		Fix:			Rather than making these options mutually exclusive
//						using if/else, both of these options can now be enabled
//						concurrently.  The AVG will take place first and then
//						the peak will be taken.

//	Modifications:
//
//		Feature:		Background threads for database functions.

//		Feature:		Panadapter is restored after SPEC mode.
//		Change:			If you are using Panadapter mode when switching to SPEC
//						DSP mode, you are automatically switched to Spectrum
//						display mode.  The console now remembers if you were in
//						Panadapter when you switched into SPEC mode and will
//						restore the Panadapter as long as the Display Mode is
//						not touched while in the SPEC mode.

//
//		Feature:		Clock Display / Updates.
//		Change:			The clock is now updated 10 times/sec in order to
//						better align the clock with the system time.  We have
//						also set the display so that you can set it to Local,
//						UTC, or Off by clicking on the date or time textboxes.
//		Coded By:		W5SXD, KE5DTO
//
//	New Features:
//
//		Feature:		1/3 and 2/3 Octave Graphic Equalizer.
//		Description:	A new facility is enabled to do a graphic (slide bar)
//						equalizer on both transmit and receive.  Both are ISO
//						standard filters.  They are NOT constant or perfect Q
//						filters as in RANE equalizers.  As such,  we have
//						limited the range of control to the range that makes
//						technical sense.  If you lower the gain applied to a
//						filter below -12dB, the notch gets WORSE.  This is caused
//						by it being in a system and the system Q getting worse
//						at that frequency.  As we implement dynamic design and
//						more efficient code, these ranges could change.
//		Coded By:		N4HY, KE5DTO
//
//      Feature:		CW Keying by external programs/keyers.
//		Description:	With this release we have added support for external
//						programs' keyers to key the radio.  On the DSP/Keyer
//						tab on the Setup Form, you will find some rearrangement
//						of the control groups.  The Primary control is expected
//						to be used to plug in a set of paddles or a hardware
//						keyer.  Secondary is to be used for all external keying
//						sources such as a third party program.  You may select
//						PTT and CW signals as indicated	on the form.  If you
//						have CAT enabled, then programs such as MixW can key
//						the DTR/RTS lines on the COM port the CAT interface is
//						currently using.  This is very nice as it allows MixW
//						to read the frequency and mode as well as key the radio
//						in CW modes through the same serial port.  This shows
//						up as CAT in the secondary keying port selection.  Note
//						that using the primary connection will override any
//						keying being performed by the seondary connection.
//		Coded By:		N4HY, KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		Virtual Audio Card Support.
//		Description:	With this release comes the much anticipated virtual
//						audio card (VAC) support.  With this added function, we
//						have eliminated the existing Card 2 controls and
//						functionality.  This enables third party software to
//						easily integrate with our software without having to
//						use a second sound card.  Since there is no	longer the
//						extra D/A and A/D connections going between the
//						applications, the signal to noise radio should be
//						improved.  For more details about where to buy the VAC
//						and how to set it up, please see the reference link
//						below.  Note that this has only been tested on the
//						Delta 44.  The functionality has been enabled for other
//						cards, but has not been tested adaquately.  Use with
//						any card other than the Delta 44 is at your own risk.
//		Coded By:		N4HY, KE5DTO
//		References:		http://www.flex-radio.com/download_files/PowerSDR/Docs/PowerSDR_VAC.pdf
//
//		Feature:		Integrated support for Soft Rock 40.
//		Description:	The Soft Rock 40 is now supported in the main console.
//						In order to make room for the new controls, the General
//						Tab was split into 3 sub tabs.  Select the model radio
//						you are using (SDR-1000, Soft Rock 40, or Demo) on the
//						Hardware Config Sub Tab.  Set the center frequency of
//						the Soft Rock after selecting it as the model.
//						Special thanks goes to Bill KD5TFD and Tony KB9YIG for
//						their work with the Soft Rock 40.
//		Coded By:		KD5TFD, adapted by KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		Wave Options added to select pre/post processing.
//		Description:	The Wave form now has a menu option to allow
//						configuration of whether to record the pre or post
//						processed signal on receive and transmit independantly.
//						This will allow a user to record someone they are
//						listening to and play it back for them over the air
//						much more easily than was previously possible.

//v1.4.5 Beta Preview 1 Released 09/21/05
//
//	Bug Fixes:
//
//		Issue:			Inconsistant hardware state after power off/on.
//		Fix:			A flaw in the design of the new hardware code was
//						causing some of the hardware not to be initialized
//						properly when powering on.  This oversight has been
//						addressed and now each and every hardware register
//						is updated when doing a power off/on sequence.
//		Reported by:	K5SDR, N5UJ
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			FM RX Frequency Deviation.
//		Fix:			In the recent QST review, it was pointed out that our
//						IMD	on FM receive was not up to par.  In checking out
//						the	code, we found that the frequency deviation was set
//						to 10kHz instead of a more typical 5kHz.  This has been
//						addressed.
//		Reported by:	KC1SX
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//
//		Issue:			Holding the up arrow on the TX Filter High cut control
//						can cause an exception.
//		Fix:			This problems arises from calling a MessageBox up from
//						within a control handler when it is rapidly being
//						changed.  We fixed this by launching the MessageBox in
//						it's own thread in order not to interact with the
//						controls natural behavior.  Note that this has been 
//						fixed in several other places where similar issues
//						might have occurred.
//		Reported by:	W5GI
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			Mouse wheel tuning interacts with Filter Width slider.
//		Fix:			This problem can be attributed to default mouse wheel
//						event handlers built into the .NET framework for some
//						controls.  We have run into the same problem with
//						UpDown controls in the past and are now using the same
//						workaround to prevent this issue (remove focus after

//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			X2-6 checkboxes do not work.
//		Fix:			The new checkboxes in 1.4.4 were missing event
//						handlers.  This prevent the last checkbox from taking
//						effect unless another box on the same line changed
//						state afterwards.  This has been fixed.
//		Reported by:	IK3VIG
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Issue:			Importing database adds bandstack registers.

//						the import function to add new rows rather than
//						overwrite the existing rows / registers.
//		Reported by:	N1RL
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//		
//	Modifications:
//
//		Feature:		AGC modified
//		Change:			The first baby steps towards implementing the AGC
//						recommendations from the Harman AGC paper are taken.
//						This process is about 1/4 complete.  This is beta code
//						and  should be viewed as such.  Attack is the attack
//						time constant.  It controls how quickly the system
//						responds to a large signal.  Decay is the decay time
//						constant.  It controls how quickly the system responds
//						to the need for increased gain.  Hang is the time the
//						system will hang at "low gain" before decaying (as in
//						ALC voltage decays) to a higher gain.  All  other 
//						controls are unimplemented.  The Leveler has a bug that
//						is not understood and as such is disabled. For now, the
//						custom controls on the DSP form for RX AGC are
//						problematic.  Until we find a mechanism for including
//						custom settings easily on the front panel AGC, please
//						use the presets. 
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//
//		Feature:		TX DSP Chain modified.
//		Change:			In order to simplify the transmit chain, the two AGC
//						components (leveler and limiter) have been modified.
//						The leveler will now only increase the gain while the
//						limiter will only decrease the gain (only if necessary
//						in both cases).
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//
//		Feature:		XIT/RIT Increment value.
//		Change:			When the bandwidth of the filter is 250Hz or larger,
//						the increment value is set to 10Hz from 50Hz.  This 
//						means that you hit the up/down arrow, it will
//						add/subtract 10 to the current value.  The previous 
//						value of 50Hz was too coarse for fine tuning on SSB.
//
//		Feature:		Escape from VFO uses last frequency.
//		Change:			While entering a new frequency, if you hit the Escape
//						button, the last frequency used will be put in the
//						VFO.  This is a good way to recover if you (or your
//						favorite pet) accidentally hits a key that changes the
//						VFO.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		Serial Keying of the CW enhanced.
//		Change:			Several new controls are now added to enhance the 
//						keying control for CW.  You may now select independent
//						keying sources for the paddle and "other sources".  The
//						other sources CANNOT use LPT keying.  That is reserved
//						for the paddle.  The other sources are restricted to
//						the Com ports only.  This is intended to allow external
//						program keying.  It is absolutely restricted "straight
//						keying" by a keyer or a program.  RTS or DTR may be
//						selected for CW keying and RTS or DTR may be selected
//						for PTT.  Some keyers and programs will PTT before they
//						send the first note.  For example, in MixW, in
//						configuration, TRCVR PTT/CAT, select details by the
//						port and configure the com port number, and make PTT
//						and CW Key selections.  Match this in the PowerSDR
//						setup panel for the new keyer.
//		Coded By:		N4HY
//
//		Feature:		PA Calibration timing changed.
//		Change:			The timing for the PA Calibration has been changed as
//						some Audigy 2 ZS users were having trouble calibrating
//						with the faster timing.  Now the timing is determined 
//						by the sound card selection.  The Audigy 2 ZS uses 3s
//						on and 4s off.  The Delta 44 uses 2s on and 2s off.
//						All others use 2.5s on and 2.5s off.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		Improved USB Adapter error handling.
//		Change:			We have modified the PowerSDR software to take
//						advantage of the error handling present in the USB
//						adapter driver.  This should prevent the driver from
//						getting "stuck", requiring a system reboot or the
//						adapter to be disconnected in rare circumstances.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		XVTR TR Mode now defaults to Positive.

//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		VOX Operation (with caveat).
//		Description:	We have implemented a simple VOX system that allows you
//						to set a threshold above which the PowerSDR software 
//						will go into TX mode for the hang time specified.  Note
//						that this will only work on the Delta 44.  
//						***CAVEAT*** Due to current hardware limitations with
//						the TR turnaround time, the first syllable will nearly
//						always be clipped by this VOX operation.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		Display Peak Hold.
//		Description:	Since the PowerSDR software can be used as a high 
//						resolution spectrum analyzer, we have added the ability
//						to hold the peak signal.  This allows the radio to be
//						used to analyze a swept tone (handy for evaluating
//						linearity).
//		Suggested By:	W5GI
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		TX Monitor Volume (TX AF).
//		Description:	When using the Delta 44, the AF control adjusts both
//						the RX audio volume and the TX monitor volume.  While
//						this is a nice feature, many times a single setting
//						does not match the RX and TX volume very well.  This
//						new control (on the Transmit Tab of the Setup Form)
//						will set the AF to the specified value in the
//						transition to TX.  Also, any changes to the AF control
//						while in TX will be reflected in this new TX AF
//						control.  This should especially help on CW modes where
//						the created tones are full scale on the TX monitor.
//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		New ISO standard EQ for RX and TX.
//		Description:	The new Equalizer can be accessed using the menu option
//						on the front panel (next to Wave).  There are options 
//						to use a 15 or 31 band ISO standard EQ to modify the RX
//						and TX audio independantly with +/- 30dB of gain.
//		Coded By:		N4HY (implementation), KE5DTO (interface)
//
//		Feature:		UCB / XVTR Support.
//		Description:	We have added complete support for the UCB (Universal
//						Controller Board) as well as a configuration screen for
//						setting up transverters with or without the UCB board.
//						This includes custom band stack registers for each
//						XVTR and direct frequency readout up to 99.9GHz.

//
//		Issue:			Transmitter splatters when overdriven, etc.
//						The transmit audio DSP chain needed a thorough grooming
//						and this is exactly what it got this weekend.  We found
//						that we were not prescaling SSB signals correctly 
//						during the last	release.  There are now two gain
//						control mechanisms in the transmit chain.  The gain
//						control at the beginning of the transmit audio chain is
//						a leveler and overdrive prevention.  It can apply as
//						much as 10dB of gain or impose -20 dB of gain 
//						(compression) if you are overdriving.  This signal is
//						now sent to	the ALC meter which replaces the Mic Meter
//						option.  At the end of the processing chain, is the
//						overdrive prevention ALC.  This applies no positive
//						gain but will impose negative gain if you go over 110%
//						of the selected power level.  It does this with a
//						linear scaling and will not cause splatter as the
//						clipper did.  The normalized TX_EQ turned out to be a
//						mistake and it is gone.  If you apply 20dB of gain
//						across the board, the ALC will roll you back.  The
//						TX_EQ rewrite WILL wait until the new audio tap
//						facility is present.  We apologize for making you go
//						through all of your settings again, but	this was
//						really needed.

//		Issue:			Buffer reset sizes wrong.
//						The ring buffer reset mechanism and the ring buffer
//						code has stabilized much in the last release, but it
//						was realized that we were not resetting the ring
//						buffers correctly.  The wrong number of 0 samples were
//						being pre-loaded when reset occurred.  This is now
//						handled by the audio system buffer size changes
//						informing us what the resize should be.

//						The TX Meter Mic setting did not work well in practice
//						for setting the Mic gain.  An ALC tap, from the correct
//						plance in the audio chain is now provided and this is
//						read by the TX Meter when in the ALC setting.  This is
//						independent of the fixed control limiter at	the end of
//						the dsp chain (described above) which is strictly to
//						prevent overdrive.

//	Bug Fixes:
//
//		Issue:			Input to TX Filters not scaled properly.
//		Fix:			In sideband modes, we take the microphone, a real input
//						signal, and we filter off either the positive 
//						frequencies to make LSB or filter the negative
//						frequencies to make USB.  This discards half of	the
//						input power.  So we have been overdriving the
//						compressor,	compander, and the limiter before to get
//						full power out of the amplifier.  This has been 
//						corrected by simply doubling the SSB output power from
//						the DSP.  For AM, FM and all double sided modulations
//						the scaling was	correct.

//		Fix:			When we go to MOX and reset the ring buffers for the
//						keyer, this must be protected from interference by
//						semaphores as all other	commands must be.  This ring
//						buffer had been left unprotected.  This revealed

//						Portaudio guarantees that it will always deliver

//						code which has all the machinery to handle other
//						more variable cases, was not optimized for our use.
//						This was easily remedied by opting for "float buffer"
//						only ring buffers.  This eliminates the possibility
//						for the generation of white noise events during times
//						of recovery.  It is more efficient since all pointers
//						are float pointers.  The CW Ring buffers get reset on
//						MOX release when going back to receive.  There were two

//		Issue:			Keyer fails when Iambic is unchecked.
//		Fix:			On those computers where the high performance counter

//	General Release Notes:
//
//		During the past week we began two major transmit development tracks.
//		One was on the transmitter code for voice which resulted in the 1.3.13
//		release.  The other development path was on making the new keyer more
//		reliable.  We inadvertantly left this keyer work in an unfinished
//		state.  While working on problems that seemed to be caused by parallel
//		port contention, we	learned that there is essentially no parallel port
//		contention because of the way the OS mirrors the port values.  This is
//		one of the MAJOR reasons PortTalk is necessary to access these 
//		protected ports.  We had unnecessarily restricted the number of times
//		per second we are reading the port whilst looking for various types of
//		PTT signals.  Writing to these ports is expensive.  Reading from them
//		is expensive _only_ when there is a change of state and is extremely
//		fast otherwise.  Using this reasoning, we have raised the polling rate
//		to 1000 times per second without measureable impact on the CPU meter or
//		amplifier power monitoring on a 2GHz Celeron in the lab.  The remaining
//		issues to be dealt with are plugging an observable glitch in the keyer
//		logic.  There is a bug in the dot/dash memory handling under certain
//		conditions.  The first dit problem was introduced in the first keyer
//		incarnation under this OS by making an error in the	ring buffer sizing.
//		This caused a ringbuffer reset to be generated often when the key was
//		first depressed for	semi-breakin.  This seems to be fixed.

//
//	Bug Fixes:
//
//		Issue:			Transmit ALC distorting output.
//		Fix:			The transmit limiter was an attempt to guarantee that
//						we had linear output and did not overdrive the
//						amplifier or the QRP version.  After careful testing,
//						it became clear that it was the primary	cause of all
//						transmit distortion in this software.  It caused the
//						Transmit Equalizer, Compressor, Compandor, etc. to
//						sound distorted.  The only thing that continued to 
//						allow the transmitter to be useful was the outstanding
//						transmit filter.  We have replaced it with the simplest
//						possible function -- a clipper.  If you overdrive, you
//						are clipped.  You are given 20% overhead.  You set the
//						voice operation by using the Peak Power METER.  The ALC
//						is no longer functional as it DOES NOT EXIST.  Using
//						the Peak Power Meter,  set the Mike gain until you are
//						around 1.0 (100W w/PA) and rarely, if ever, hit	above
//						that.	 If you hit 1.2 (120 w/PA all the time, you are
//						being clipped.  You will not overdrive the amp 
//						excessively and you will not splatter because of the 
//						terrific transmit filters but expect to be highly
//						distorted.

//		Issue:			100W Peak Power reading wrong on analog meter.

//		Issue:			First dit truncation.

//		1.3.9 contains the first implementation of resizing.
//		We have placed limitations on it to get you to concentrate
//		on helping us do debugging.   We need to further decouple
//		the audio system from the dsp side so we can have completely
//		independently selectable dsp and audio buffer sizes.  There
//		are still some constraints in this code.
//
//		Soon you will be able to set 16384 size audio buffers, and 256
//		size dsp buffers or 256 size audio buffers and 4096 size dsp
//		buffers, etc. The other thing is we have not sufficiently
//		decoupled the fft size from the audio and dsp sizes so that will
//		have to be done.  
//
//		If the gotcha's with this dsp release are not too great, the next
//		thing will be the keyer.  Otherwise, we concentrate on bug fixes.
//
//		A neat thing to do is to put on a narrow DSP filter on CW (say
//		100 Hz) and to decrease the dsp size (don't forget to lower the
//		audio size FIRST). You will see the dsp filter in the SPECTRUM

//	Modifications:
//
//		Feature:		Delta 44 Max VRMS Change.
//		Description:	Previously the max VRMS for the Delta 44 was set at 3.8V.
//						However, this was measured on the +4dBu output setting.
//						This poses a serious risk of overdriving the amplifier if
//						the PA is not calibrated correctly as the PA needs less
//						than 1 Volt to drive it to 100W.  For this reason, we are
//						changing the voltage for the Delta 44 to read 0.98V.  It 
//						is imperative that the output be changed to match this
//						new voltage setting on the Delta 44 control panel.  Use
//						the -10dBv setting for the output.  Note that the new
//						voltage may get reset if importing a database from an
//						older version.  I will get with N9VV and have him update
//						the screenshots on his site.

//		Coded By:		KE5DTO
//
//		Feature:		Hardware Code Rewrite.
//		Description:	We have completely rewritten the hardware code interface
//						with two main goals in mind.  First, we wanted to allow
//						updates to be written in an atomic manner with respect to
//						each of the 6 8-bit registers (2 on PIO board, 4 on RFE).
//						This should give a significant improvement when compared
//						to accessing each bit on each register atomically which
//						requires as many as 8 times as many writes to the hardware.
//						Second, the code was in bad need of being reorganized to
//						incorporate all of the additions to the original 3 board
//						stack in a coherent style.  The older hardware code had
//						become somewhat *cough* confusing due to just tacking on
//						new code to support new products.

//	Modifications:

//	New Features:
//
//		Feature:		Second sound card support. 
//		Description:	The long awaited dual sound card solution is implemented
//						in this version.  Note that it is necessary to configure
//						details of the second sound card configuration using the
//						new controls on the Audio Tab of the Setup Form.  Select
//						to show details from Card #2 and then fill out the Driver,
//						Input, Output, Mixer, Receive, and Transmit selections.
//						ASIO may only be used for one device, so MME is recommended
//						for Card #2.  The voltage for Card #2 _MUST_ be entered if
//						using the FlexRadio 100W PA in order to control the audio
//						drive correctly.  In order to use the AF control for monitor
//						volume and the PWR control for transmit power, it is necessary
//						to run the Second Sound Card Calibration by pushing the button
//						located directly to the right of the enable checkbox.  Make
//						sure the wiring is correct and the power is on before running
//						this test.  The wiring setup is below:
//
//							Card 1:
//								Line In  -->  SDR-1000 "To Line In"
//								Mic		 -->  No Connection
//								Line Out -->  Y-splitter -- Card 2 Line In & Speakers
//							Card 2:
//								Line In  --> Card 1 Line Out (as above)
//								Mic		 --> SDR-1000 "To Mic In" (or just PC Mic)

//		Feature:		M-Audio Delta 44 Support. 
//		Description:	This high performance card is now a supported card offering
//						a really nice advantage.  It allows independant output power
//						and monitor volume.  Use the PWR control for output power
//						and the AF control for monitor volume.  The audio will be
//						muted during transmit if the monitor is not active.  Note that 
//						the output is a whopping 3.8VRMS.  Please use caution when
//						using this with 1W configurations as there is currently
//						nothing keeping you from running the output full blast
//						(configurations with the PA take the Max VRMS into account
//						and are therefore protected).  The inputs and outputs are
//						described below:
//
//							Input 1 & 2: SDR-1000 "To Line In"
//							Input 3: Amplified Microphone (can use 2nd card for preamp)
//							Input 4: Line Out from 2nd card (optional -- for digital modes)
//							
//							Output 1 & 2: Speakers/Monitor (use Y-splitter for digital modes

//						serial port program available at the following address supplied
//						by Bill, KD5TFD:

//		Coded By:		K5KDN, KD5TFD
//
//		Feature:		Transmit Image/Opposite Sideband Null
//		Description:	With second sound card support, it has become more important 
//						that we allow for nulling the opposite sideband on TX.  We are   
//						legal with almost all sound cards but we have the ability to be  
//						the "best" with this nulling.  The primary limitation is that 
//						there is no second IF and no feedback mechanism.  We are limited  
//						to nulling using a second receiver. An attempt was made to use the
//						high end sound card to null the gain imbalance from the second  
//						(or TX) sound card.  This works just beautifully but it is
//						 not the whole picture. The SDR is a system and this did not 
//						include gain imbalance in the TX hardware (QSE) in the SDR-1000.
//						As such, we found the automatic null using only the sound card
//						was worse than doing nothing on some cards.  The sliders for 
//						this nulling are in the same place as the image rejection
//						sliders for RX on the Setup/DSP panel. There is a new 
//						combination box that allows you to choose between TX and RX
//						nulling.

//
//		Feature:		ThreadSafe Controls
//		Description:	This is more of a "behind-the-scenes" feature, but it is worth noting.
//						Rather than continue to add as much as 8 lines per property of each
//						control we would like to be able to control from any thread, we
//						decided to approach this in a much more object oriented sense and
//						just create custom controls that are in themselves threadsafe.  This
//						solution is not only cleaner (savings of >1000 lines of code
//						immediately), but also a better ongoing solution as we will not have
//						to worry about whether someone has actually checked if their control
//						properties are safe.

//	Modifications:

//		Feature:		Image Null controls are now floats (were ints).
//		Description:	The Image Null controls were previously limited to integer
//						values and for that reason were missing the optimal null in
//						between	the available control values.  This has been changed
//						so that the DSP will accept floating point numbers and the
//						updown controls send fractional information.  In addition to
