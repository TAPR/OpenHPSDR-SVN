// Accessing the Mixer Functions.
// A data structure is stored for each instance of the mixer.  A pointer to the data structure is required
// to use the corresponding instance of the mixer.  That pointer can either be stored in a central bank of
// pointers and accessed using an 'id', OR, the owner of the mixer can store the pointer and use it in the
// various calls to the mixer.  In using the create_aamix(...) function, if a negative value is supplied for
// the 'id', a pointer will NOT be stored in the central bank; the function will also ALWAYS return the pointer
// which may be used or ignored.  In calls to other mixer functions, there are parameters for both 'id' and 'ptr'.
// If ptr == 0, the id will be used.  If ptr != 0, the pointer, supplied as 'ptr', will be used.
//
// The audio mixer is created with a specific number of inputs, 'ninputs'.
// 'ninputs' should be the MAXIMUM number of data streams that the creator will need to mix.
//
// Of these total 'ninputs', some can be active and some inactive at any point in time.  SetAAudioMixState()
// is used to set whether an input is active or not.  Data MUST CONTINUOUSLY flow into all the active inputs.
// To be able to mix the input samples and produce output, the mixer MUST have samples from each input stream.
// Therefore, if there is no data flowing in from even one active input, the mixer will be unable to produce
// any output.
//
// SetAAudioMixState() is intended to be used, for example, when a new receiver is created in the radio or when
// a receiver is removed from the radio.  It is NOT intended for use just to turn OFF/ON whether a stream is
// currently being mixed into the output stream.  Why?  Because its transition is much slower than using
// SetAAudioMixWhat().  (Keep reading for discussion of that.)
//
// Note also that if a stream is marked active and data is not yet flowing, the mixer will block until data flows!
//
// Having continuous data flow to all inputs does NOT imply that all inputs will always be mixed into the output.
// The content of the output, at any given time, is determined by which bits are set in the word 'what'.  Note
// that 'what' can be changed at any time, while data is flowing.  Turning a bit OFF/ON in 'what' could be used,
// for example, to MUTE/UNMUTE a particular software receiver.  Call SetAAudioMixWhat() to use this functionality.
//
// Individual volume settings are provided for each input.  There is also a master volume setting that applies
// to all inputs.  The individual and master volume settings can be changed anytime, while data is flowing.
//
// There is a ring buffer corresponding to each input stream.  When the ring for each input has at least the
// number of samples required for one 'outsize' output buffer, mixing proceeds and the output buffer is filled.
// A resampler is provided for each input and is activated if the input sample rate for that input does not
// match the specified output sample rate for the mixer.  The resampling occurs BEFORE data is entered into the
// ring.  This implies that the input size 'ringinsize' is the same for each ring.  Obviously the amount of
// data supplied to xMixAudio(), i.e., to the resampler, would vary depending upon input sample rate.
//
// The mixer supports changing 'outsize' and 'ringinsize' while data is flowing.  However, it is anticipated that
// these parameters would likely be set when the radio is created and not be changed after that.
//
//
// Mixer slewing.
// When the mixer is to be 'closed' to add or remove an input using SetAAudioMixState(), provision is made to
// downslew before stopping the output and to upslew when the mixer is again 'opened'.
//
// When data is continuously flowing for all active inputs, operation is as follows.  SetAAudioMixState() calls
// close_mixer() where the a->slew.dflag is set.  Because this flag is set, for subsequent processing of data 
// buffers in xaamix(), downslew() is called.  When the downslew completes, the downslew() function resets the
// a->slew.dflag.  In parallel with the downslewing activity in xaamix() and downslew(), the thread calling 
// SetAAudioMixState() and subsequently close_mixer() is blocked waiting for semaphore a->slew.dwait.  This 
// prevents further closure of the mixer until the downslew is complete.  Once the semaphore is released by 
// the downslew() function, the mixer will be closed.  At that point, the changes in "MixState" are made and
// open_mixer() is then called.  a->slew.uflag is immediately set so that, when output buffers begin to flow
// in xaamix(), an upslew() will occur.  After setting the flag, the rest of the operations to open the mixer
// are completed.  However, the open_mixer() function blocks the calling thread until the upslew is complete
// using the a->slew.uwait semaphore.  With the calling-thread blocking on downslew and upslew, we are
// insured that multiple successive calls to SetAAudioMixState() will be properly handled.
//
// At initial startup, when there is no data flowing, calls to SetAAudioMixState() can still be made without
// creating a permanent block on the calling thread.  Each of the semaphore waits (one for downslew and the
// other for upslew) has a timeout that is set to be slightly greater than the downslew or upslew time.
// Therefore, the timeouts do not occur if data is flowing and the slews happen; however, if there is no data
// flowing, the timeouts prevent a permanent block of the calling thread.
//
// NOTE:  The above describes two distinct valid modes of operation:  (1) no data is flowing during the entire
// close_mixer() and open_mixer() process, and (2) data is continually flowing during the entire close_mixer()
// and open_mixer() process.  Correct operation will NOT be preserved if data flow starts or stops during
// these operations.  
//
// Calling SetAAudioMixState() on the same thread used to turn ON/OFF dataflow (for example by setting the 
// 'run' bit or setting 'enable' bits) can be used to keep this properly sorted out.  If data is NOT flowing,
// just do NOT start it until the call to SetAAudioMixState() returns.  If data IS flowing, simply do NOT
// turn it off until the call to SetAAudioMixState() returns.
