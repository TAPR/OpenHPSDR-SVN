        GPIO Checked Out




I have all the GPIO lines wiggling through the DB25 and DB9
connectors.  All seems to be OK and the lines match up correctly.

In gpio_control.v the 24 GPIO lines are mapped as Port0, Port1, Port2.

GPIO1-8 : Outputs: Port0: 8 bits

GPIO9-16: Outputs: Port1: 8 bits

GPIO17-24: Inputs: Port2: 8 bits

The register address for the ports are as follows:

Port0: 0x01
Port1: 0x02
Port2: 0x03

All ports can be read.  Only Ports0 and 1 can be written.  A write to
Port2 does nothing.

If you load up the gpio_control verilog you can use:

write_SPI 0xfffe 0x7 0x01 0x00 turns on all LEDS

write_SPI 0xfffe 0x7 0x01 0xFF turns off all LEDS

Once we get the documentation from Sami, I think we can move all high
level functions of the parallel control to the FX2.  That way we won't
have to send the bitbanging over USB.
