<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file dc_fifo.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design dc_fifo.v. The design dc_fifo.v has a depth of 64 words of 8 bits each. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode. The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>
