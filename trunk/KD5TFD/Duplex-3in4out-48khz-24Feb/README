This is the Verilog source for the 48 khz 3 in 4 out FPGA code.  
It's a Quartus project and should be buildable by anyone with the 
Quartus II toolset.  I'm using Quartus II 5.1 Web Edition Build 176 

To build this all you should have to do is open Duplex.qpf with Quartus
and select Processing -> Start Compilation.  It should produce a 
Duplex.rbf file  -- with about 38 warnings. 

This code is based on Phil Harman's (VK6APH) 24Feb Duplex Pre Janus 
.qar archive.  I've modified it slightly to work with my work 
PowerSDR code supporting 3in 4out.
