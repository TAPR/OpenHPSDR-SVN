// Raised cosine will be applied over 5mS. Profile consists of 1000 samples and is read from ROM.
// ROM address is read forwards for key press and backwards for key release.
// Clock is at 192kHz which is an integer multiple of 48kHz so we don't cross clock domains. 
// profile_ROM holds the profile values. Values are in profile.mif.
// For reverse read we need to keep the CW note and carrier operating - use PTT to do this.
// The max value of the profile has been slected to give the maximum output of the RF DAC taking into account
// the CORDIC gain. 
// When used to profile the RF a delay can be set that delays the RF following the key being pressed. 
// The delay is applied to the CW element such that length of the element is maintained i.e. the length
// of the element is increased by the delay time. 
// IMPORTANT:  The lenght of the delay must be shorter than the duration of a dot.
// At the end of the trailing profile a hang delay can be applied after no key closures for the hang delay period. 
// This extends the PTT for the delay period. During the hang delay the key is monitored.

// NOTE:  At 20 WPM a dot is 60mS and at 60 WPM 20mS using standard PARIS timing
