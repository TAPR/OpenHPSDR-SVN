	The code implements an Iambic CW keyer.  The following features are supported:
		
		* Variable speed control from 1 to 60 WPM
		* Dot and Dash memory
		* Straight, Bug, Iambic Mode A or B Modes
		* Variable character weighting
		* Automatic Letter spacing
		* Paddle swap
		
	Dot and Dash memory works by registering an alternative paddle closure whilst a paddle is pressed.
	The alternate paddle closure can occur at any time during a paddle closure and is not limited to being 
	half way through the current dot or dash. This feature could be added if required.
	
	In Straight mode, closing the DASH paddle will result in the output following the input state.  This enables a 
	straight morse key or external Iambic keyer to be connected.
	
	In Bug mode closing the dot paddle will send repeated dots.
	
	The difference between Iambic Mode A and B lies in what the keyer does when both paddles are released. In Mode A the 
	keyer completes the element being sent when both paddles are released. In Mode B the keyer sends an additional
	element opposite to the one being sent when the paddles are released. 
	
	This only effects letters and characters like C, period or AR. The following diagram shows the difference between 
	sending the character C in each mode.

	Automatic Letter Space works as follows: When enabled, if you pause for more than one dot time between a dot or dash
	the keyer will interpret this as a letter-space and will not send the next dot or dash until the letter-space time has been met.
	The normal letter-space is 3 dot periods. The keyer has a paddle event memory so that you can enter dots or dashes during the
	inter-letter space and the keyer will send them as they were entered. 

	Speed calculation -  Using standard PARIS timing, dot_period(mS) = 1200/WPM
