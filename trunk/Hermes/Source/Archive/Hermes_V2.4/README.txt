Changes in this firmware version relative to Hermes_v2.3:

- fixed Alex 6m preamp switching bug,

- reduced the Alex SPI bus speed by half to permit longer ribbon cable connections to Alex,
 
- assigned unused Rx freqs to the Tx freq, thereby improving Alex switching reliability when selecting HPF/LPF filters,

- changed the 1.5MHz HPF filter switchover freq to 1416 KHz and the 80m LPF switchover freq
  to 2400 KHz to accommodate "stitched" mode rx at up to 384 ksps sampling rates, 

- changed version number to 2.4.
