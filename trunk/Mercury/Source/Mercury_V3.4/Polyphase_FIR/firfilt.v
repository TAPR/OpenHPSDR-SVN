// Polyphase decimating filter

// Based on firX8R8 by James Ahlstrom, N2ADR,  (C) 2011
// Modified for use with HPSDR and DC spur removed by Phil Harman, VK6APH, (C) 2013


// This is a decimate by 8 Polyphase FIR filter. Since it decimates by 8 the output signal
// level will be 1/8 the input level.  The filter coeficients are distributed between the 8 
// FIR filters such that the first FIR receives coeficients 0, 7, 15... the second 1, 8, 16.. the 
// third 2, 9, 17.. etc.  The coeficients are calculated as per normal but there is no need to 
// compensate for the sinx/x shape of the preceeding CIC filters. This is because the filter 
// decimates by 8 and the droop of the CIC at 1/8th its fs/2 is neglibible. 
// The filter coefficients are in the file "coefL8.txt". This is split into 8 individual 
// Quartus ROM *.mif files.

// The filter coefficients are also attenuated such that the result of the multiply and accumalate 
// does not exceed 24 bits. 

// Note: Gain is higher than previous filter code by 6dB so reduce outside this module.
// FIR filters
//
// ROM init file:		REQUIRED, with 256 or 512 coefficients.  See below.
// Number of taps:	NTAPS.
// Input bits:			18 fixed.
// Output bits:		OBITS, default 24.
// Adder bits:			ABITS, default 24.

// This requires eight MifFile's.
// Maximum NTAPS is 8 * (previous and current decimation) less overhead.
// Maximum NTAPS is 2048 (or less).
