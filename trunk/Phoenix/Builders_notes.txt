Things I've found so far in the build - Phil - VK6APH 

1. Pads for LEDs are a little far apart.
2. Markings on LEDs - Green and Yellow have the green band as cathode, Red 
has green band for the anode (I hope there is a special place in hell for 
the genius that came up with this idea!).
3. Watch the LED orientations - I have  D1, D2, D4, D5 with the green band 
towards the edge of the board and D3 the reverse.
4. U10 does not appear to be the correct part - fitted one from my junk box.
5. C60,61,13,14,15, 16 either pads too small or part too big. - replaced with smaller from junk box.
6. Link pins 1 and 5 of U5,7,8,9,20 else they shutdown - PCB needs modifying.

At this stage all voltage regulators working and PSU LEDs alight

7. -10 volt rail is a little high at -11.2v - perhaps adjust divider resitors
8. CPLD loads OK - green LED on!
