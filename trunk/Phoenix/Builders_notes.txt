Things I've found so far in the build - Phil - VK6APH 

1. Pads for LEDs are a little far apart.
2. Markings on LEDs - Green and Yellow have the green band as cathode, Red 
has green band for the anode (I hope there is a special place in hell for 
the genius that came up with this idea!).
3. Watch the LED orientations - I have  D1, D2, D4, D5 with the green band 
towards the edge of the board and D3 the reverse.
4. U10 does not appear to be the correct part - fitted one from my junk box.
5. C60,61,13,14,15, 16 either pads too small or part too big. - replaced with smaller from junk box.
6. Link pins 1 and 5 of U5,7,8,9,20 else they shutdown - PCB needs modifying.

At this stage all voltage regulators working and PSU LEDs alight

7. -10 volt rail is a little high at -11.2v - perhaps adjust divider resistors?
8. CPLD loads OK - green LED on!
9. Pads for T1,2,4,5,6 a little small but most likely OK for reflow soldering
10. L13.14.15,16 pads too wide or parts too small - used small parts with wire links
11. U12 is connected to the 3.3v rail but is a 5v part. 
    I decided not to fit U12 since the 3.3v drive from the CPLD may not be sufficient.
    Instead I fitted a potential divider (10k/10k) to the input of U27 so as to give 
    3.3/2v at pin 3. One end of a 10k goes to pin 8 of U12, the junction to pin 7
    and the other to pin 5. There maybe an 3.3v version of U12. 

At this stage will receive at 12MHz !!
Note to self - set input jumpers on Janus to take balanced input

12. Track missing between pins 7 and 8 of U3 and C15
13. C13,14,15,16 should be reversed.
14. U2 pin connections are wrong, reverse connections to pins 2 & 3 and 5 & 6

At this stage will transmit at 12MHz - need to use PTT on Janus to Tx

Added CPLD code so now will Tx from PowerSDR.

When testing Tx fit LPF on output or waveform will look odd on 'scope.  

15. Balanced output connector on Phoenix is different to that used on Janus so
    can't use Ethernet cable to link the two boards. 
16. Pads on the ends of F2 a little far apart.
17. Is the 3dB frequency of F2 correct? It's 320MHz whilst the highest DDS frequency
    will be 4 x 55MHz = 220MHz. Perhaps a lower corner frequency

Testing AD9912

18. Set S1,S2 & S4 to 0 via R24,R29,R31 and S3 to 1 via R25. This enables the AD9912
    to be tested without loading the CPLD by connecting a 48MHz sine wave clock to BUS_CLK. 
    S3 = 1 also selects the AD9912 PLL which is need.
19. Set AD9912 as above and check for a signal at about 100MHz at T5. 

 
At this stage can load latest CPLD code and run Janus_Ozy and can set frequency of 
AD9912!

20. The AD9912 PLL does not lock correctly when run from the 48MHz clock from the CPLD.
    PLacing a 1k in place of JP2 with a 100pf to ground at C42 cures this. It maybe
    that the PLL loop is not correct for a PLL x 20 - will investigate.
