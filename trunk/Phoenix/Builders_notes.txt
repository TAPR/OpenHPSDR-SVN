Things I've found so far in the build - Phil - VK6APH 

1. Pads for LEDs are a little far apart.
2. Markings on LEDs - Green and Yellow have the green band as cathode, Red 
has green band for the anode (I hope there is a special place in hell for 
the genius that came up with this idea!).
3. Watch the LED orientations - I have  D1, D2, D4, D5 with the green band 
towards the edge of the board and D3 the reverse.
4. U10 does not appear to be the correct part - fitted one from my junk box.
5. C60,61,13,14,15, 16 either pads too small or part too big. - replaced with smaller from junk box.
6. Link pins 1 and 5 of U5,7,8,9,20 else they shutdown - PCB needs modifying.

At this stage all voltage regulators working and PSU LEDs alight

7. -10 volt rail is a little high at -11.2v - perhaps adjust divider resistors
8. CPLD loads OK - green LED on!
9. Pads for T1,2,4,5,6 a little small but most likely OK for reflow soldering
10. L13.14.15,16 pads too wide or parts too small - used small parts with wire links
11. U12 is connected to the 3.3v rail but is a 5v part. 
    I decided not to fit U12 since the 3.3v drive from the CPLD may not be sufficient.
    Instead I fitted a potential divider (10k/10k) to the input of U27 so as to give 
    3.3/2v at pin 3. One end of a 10k goes to pin 8 of U12, the junction to pin 7
    and the other to pin 5. There maybe an 3.3v version of U12. 

At this stage will receive at 12MHz !!
Note to self - set input jumpers on Janus to take balanced input

12. Track missing between pins 7 and 8 of U3 and C15
