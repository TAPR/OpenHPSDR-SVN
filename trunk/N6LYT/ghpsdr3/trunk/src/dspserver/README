dspserver - Application for running HPSDR on Linux

dspserver is an application written specifically for HPSDR. It uses a modifed version of DttSP that is ported from the Windows version. DttSP is built as a static library that is linked with the server code.

The following has been verified with a clean install of Ubunto 9.04.

Building dspserver
------------------

You will need to install fftw

    sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev

If you are going to build DttSP.a you will also need to install libgsl

    sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev

From the dspserver install directory run the command

    make

If all is OK you will end up with the dspserver binary.

Running dspserver
-----------------

From the ghpsdr3 bin directory run the command:

./dspserver --receiver R --server a.b.c.d

command line options:

    --receiver rx

       default 0
       for HPSDR running multiple receivers this should be 0..3
       for softrock only 0 is supported.

    --server a.b.c.d

       default 127.0.0.1
       IP address of hardware server.
