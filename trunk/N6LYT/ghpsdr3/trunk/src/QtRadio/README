The beginnings of a more feature rich Qt 4 radio.

Warning - this is an in progress development so may not even compile and not all menus, buttons may be implemented yet.

This works connecting to the dspserver.  There is a new dspserver to support
the added functions. Alwasy use the latest dspserver with this code.

Now setup to use QtCreator  development environment than NetBeans. This code compile on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
