The beginnings of a more feature rich Qt 4 radio.

Warning - this is an in progress development so may not even compile and not all menus, buttons may be implemented yet.

This works connecting to the dspserver.  There is a new dspserver to support
the added functions. Alwasy use the latest dspserver with this code.

Now setup to use QtDesigner rather than NetBeans.
