ghpsdr - Gtk+ Application for running HPSDR on Linux

ghpsdr is a an application written specifically for HPSDR. It uses a version of WDSP that is ported from the Windows version. WDSP is built as a shared library. and can be downloaded from my svn (N6LYT/wdsp).

The following has been verified with a clean install of Ubuntu.

Building ghpsdr
---------------

You will need to install gtk+, fftw and libusb1.0

    sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
    sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
    sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev

Get a copy of wdsp from the svn store and build and install it (see README.txt file in wdsp).

From the ghpsdr install directry run the command

    make

If all is OK you will end up with the ghpsdr binary.


Running ghpsdr with Ozy or Magister
-----------------------------------

To be able to run as a non root user you will need to add a udev script to set the permissions on the USB Ozy device.

In /etc/udev/rules.d create a file called 90-ozy.rules with the following line in it:

SUBSYSTEMS=="usb",ATTRS{idVendor}=="fffe",ATTRS{idProduct}=="0007",SYMLINK+="ozy",MODE="666"

When Ozy is powered on and plugged in udev will recognise it and create /dev/ozy with permissions to allow you to access it as a non root user.

You will also need to download initozy and the related files to load Ozy and the FPGA code.



From the ghpsdr install directory run the command:

./ghpsdr --usb


Note: this is currently not tested. The default now is to use the ehternet interface/


Running ghpsdr with Metis
-------------------------


From the ghpsdr install directory run the command:

./ghpsdr

The first thing that ghpsdr does is to run a discovery of devices on the network interfaces. If it finds more than one a dialog box is displayed to let you select the device to run with.
