		2011 March 02 - added microphone or line in selection
		           04 - add support for multiple Mercury receivers/boards - Joe K5SO
				   12 - added DHCP server address to DHCPREQUEST.
				   28 - Modify code such that multiple Metis boards can be used. Allow Discovery from different PC to that sending
				        Start/Stop. Save PC IP address etc independantly for Discovery and other commands.
			 Apr    2 - Reset sequence number when not running rather then when Discovery received.  
			        3 - Add wide band spectrum and on/off enable
			 May   13 - Added independant serial number for wide bandscope data.
			 July  29 - Added FWD and REV power from Penny(Lane)
			 Sep   12 - Added support for manual selection of Alex relays. Released as V1.5.
			          - Added PennyLane/Hermes Drive level to existing C&C data rather than an additional nWire. Removed C18 connection						 
						**** Built using Quartus V9.1 sp2 ****

		2012 Oct   3 - changes by Joe K5SO 
						 - Added line in gain (line_boost) control for Penny(Lane)
						 - Fixed bug in C&C byte stream selection/assignments of frequencies for multiple receivers
						 - Added independent manual control of HPF/LPF relays for Alex 2
						 - Added user output connections for pins 1-4 on the DB-9 connector on Metis, mapped to 
						   bits C3[3:0] when C0[7:1] = 0001_010 as follows: 
								USEROUT0: DB9 pin 1 = C3[0] open drain output, FPGA pin 134
								USEROUT1: DB9 pin 2 = C3[1] open drain output, FPGA pin 135
								USEROUT2: DB9 pin 3 = C3[2] 3.3V TTL output, FPGA pin 137
								USEROUT3: DB9 pin 4 = C3[3] 3.3V TTL output, FPGA pin 173
						 - Released as version number v1.9 

						 
	   2012 Oct 21 - changes by Joe K5SO
						- added default power up clock select for 122.88 MHz clock to be Penelope
						- Released as version number v2.0
						**** Bulit using Quartus II V11.1 sp2 ****

	   2012 Oct 26 - changes by Joe K5SO
			- fixed bug in Rx freq assignments that resulted in improper freq assignments 
				when certain hardware configurations/PC options are selected
			- Released as version number v2.1
						
	   2012 Dec  3  - Compiler configuration changes to eliminate hangs on certain FPGAs
		    21  - Added IP setting and reading in normal mode plus directed ARP.
		    29  - Added PHY FIFO and new method to convert nibbles to byte.
		    30  - Added ability to read and set IP address without needing to be in bootloader mode.
			- Released as v2.3
	    2013 Jan 8  - fixed ethernet ARP request response bug
			- Released as v2.4
		    26  - changed IP set to use UDP rather than raw Ethernet frames. Once IP is set board will reset to load new address.
		Feb 15  - Increased ARP and ping time outs read for faster sampling rates.
			- Released as v2.5
		     24 - Changed ARP sequencer to prevent hang with some PCs
			- Released as v2.5a
		May 3   - changes by Joe K5SO: replaced i2c comm module with new i2c interface and master modules 
				to pass firmware version numbers, Penny output power, FWD, REV, and ADC overload status 
				signals via the i2c bus (Atlas A20/A21)instead of via NWire comm lines. Re-configured 
				Atlas A3, A4, A5, A8, A9, and A10 to receive Rx1 I data on A10, Rx1 Q data on A5, Rx2 I data on A9, 
				Rx2 Q data on A4, Rx3 I data on A8, and Rx3 Q data on A3, in order to support 384ksps Rx sampling rates
				for up to three receivers on a single Mercury or three Mercury boards.  
			- Changed version number to v2.6.
		     27 - Increased wideband FIFO to 16k words, released as V2.6a
		Jun  5  - Added mic boost, released as V2.6b.
	  2014  Mar 14 	- Added wideband data on/off
			- Fully constrained the firmware design, closed timing
			- Released as V2.7.
		Mar 15	- Opened IO timing delays to an additional max/min: 1/-1 nSec, for both input delays and output delays
			- Closed timing
			- Changed version number to v2.8
