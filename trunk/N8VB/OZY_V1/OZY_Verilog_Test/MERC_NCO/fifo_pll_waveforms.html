<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file fifo_pll.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altpll megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design fifo_pll.v. The design fifo_pll.v has Cyclone II FAST pll configured in NORMAL mode The primary clock input to the PLL is INCLK0, with clock period 20833 ps. CLK0 multiply by = 2, CLK0 divide by = 1, CLK0 phase_shift = 0 Output port LOCKED is used. This port will go high when the PLL locks to the input clock. Input port ARESET is used. This port is active high. When asserted, it will cause the LOCKED port and all CLK outputs to drop to zero. The PLL will relock to the input clock when this port is deasserted. </P>
