# with EA = 0, the FX2 implements a portion of the 8051 "external memory"
# on chip.  This memory is mapped like this:
#
# The bottom 16K of memory (0x0000 - 0x3fff) is used for both data and
# code accesses.  There's also 512 bytes for data only from 0xe000 - 0xe1ff.
#
# We tell the linker to start the xdata segment at 0x1800, 6K up from
# the bottom.
