If you are trying to read an I2C EEPROM use read_EEPROM.exe instead.  To
set the start address of data to be read from the EEPROM, you must first
write the starting address to a register in the EEPROM - read_EEPROM
does this.   

read_I2C lets you read from a specific I2C address a specified amount of
bytes.  You cannot specify the starting address because it does not make 
sense as far as I2C goes.  In the EEPROM example there is a certain 
sequence you have to follow to read from a specific address WITHIN the
EEPROM - there is a difference between the EEPROM's I2C address and 
internal addresses within the EEPROM.
