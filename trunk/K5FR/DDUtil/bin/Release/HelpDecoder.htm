<h2><u><font color="#800080"><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</font></font></u></h2>
<p>This program provides the 
	automation required to decode and present <b>transmit</b> frequency data to select 
frequency sensitive devices such as linear amplifiers, antenna controllers (SteppIR), 
antenna tuners, antenna band switchers, etc. <b>DDUtil</b> may be used in 
a stand-alone mode or with a radio control program such as DXLab Commander, Ham 
Radio Deluxe, Mix2W or any other radio control program that can use standard 
Kenwood CAT commands for communication with <b>PowerSDR</b>. 
<p><b>DDUtil</b> 
automatically senses when a radio control program is trying to communicate with 
<b>PowerSDR</b> and modifies it's mode of operation requiring no user 
intervention. See the <a href="#How">&quot;How it Works&quot;</a> section for 
a more detailed description of program design.<p>An XML file is used to 
provide the reference data needed for the BCD output data. A sample file is 
included with the distribution files to serve as a guide. This file may be 
created from scratch or modified from the sample provided and then saved with 
an appropriate user name. All file modification may be 
accomplished within the program or may be done in any XML file 
editor of the users choice. But, unless the user is familiar with XML file 
editing it is recommended that XML file modification be confined to <b>DDUtil</b> 
until proficiency is obtained. Please note that this file requires a specific 
format see the <b>'BCD Data File Format'</b> topic in <a href="#Other">Other Topics</a> for details.<p>The initial release is designed for the Flex 
family of radios including the SDR-1000 and Flex5000 series, but may well be 
extended to other radios in the future.<h2><u><font color="#800080">
<a name="Install"></a>Installation</font></u></h2>
<ul>
	<li><u><b>Prerequisites:</b></u><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DDUtil</b> requires 
Microsoft .NET 2.0 in order to load and function. The setup file will automatically guide 
you through this installation if your pc doesn't have it. Just follow the 
prompts and select x86 when it asks you which one you want to download.</li>
	<li>Execute the file <b>'DDUtil_Setup.msi'</b>, follow the prompts, accept the defaults and you 
should get a Icon on your desktop like this one.
	<img border="0" src="DDUtilicon.JPG" width="32" height="32"> </li>
	<li>Additionally, there is an entry in your pc's <b>Programs</b> group for
	<b>DDUtil</b> should 
the desktop icon be lost This can be reached by selecting Start/All 
Programs/DDUtil</li>
	<li>Be advised that <b>DDUtil</b> must be uninstalled before updating to a newer 
version. The installer will tell you also.</li>

<h2><u><font color="#800080"><a name="Scenario"></a>Usage</font></u></h2>
<p>Using the <b>DDUtil</b> is straight forward and shouldn't require more than a 
minimal amount of familiarization for the user to be comfortable with it's use. 
</p>
<p>All control settings on the <b>DDUtil</b> forms are stored and remembered 
from session to session.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Hardware Setup</b><p>The following information is required to connect 
	<b>DDUtil </b>&nbsp;to your 
	device.<ul>
		<li>What kind of device do you want to control (amplifier, antenna 
		switch, etc.).</li>
		<li>Is the device RS-232 or BCD driven.</li>
		<li>If RS-232 driven, set the device receiving the data to a Kenwood or 
		Yaesu model and speed to match 9600 8-N-1.</li>
		<li>If BCD driven, you must:<ul>
			<li>Know the BCD scheme (what codes do what) See the manufactures 
			user manual for this.</li>
			<li>Build a cable configured to fit your hardware setup (DB25M to 
			your device input port). See the cable
		<a href="Cables.pdf">drawing</a> for example 
			information.</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Program Operation</b> - The following operations assume the proper 
	setups have been performed on the Ports and Device tabs.<ul>
		<li><b>DDUtil</b> as stand-alone.<ul>
			<li>Start <b>PowerSDR</b>, start <b>DDUtil</b>.</li>
			<li>If all is setup correctly you should see the frequency and VFO A in the header bar as [7,033.83] (VFO A/B). If instead you see 
			[not connected] there is a problem and some back tracking is in 
			order. The most common problem will be wrong port setup for <b>PowerSDR</b> (CAT) port or the CAT Polling Interval is way off, try 1000 
			for this setting.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>DDUtil</b> used with a radio control/logging program.<ul>
			<li>Start <b>PowerSDR</b>, start <b>DDUtil</b> and you should now 
			see connect data in the title bar that looks something like 
			[7,033.83] (VFO A). </li>
			<li>Start your radio control/logging program. If everything is 
			working right you should see something like [RC] [7,033.83] (VFO 
			A) in the title bar of <b>DDUtil</b> and your radio 
			control/logging program should show it has control of <b>PowerSDR</b>. 
			</li>
			<li><u><b>Note:</b></u> The <b>[RC]</b> stands for Radio Control program is in use. If 
			the [RC] is not in the title bar the program is in <b>Stand-Alone</b> 
			mode.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Tool Tips (description of control function) are available for all controls by 
		hovering the mouse over the control momentarily.</li>
		<li>Once setup, <b>DDUtil</b> can either 
		be minimized or reduced to a minimal size for normal operation. Shrinking is 
		accomplished by <b>right</b> clicking anywhere on the form (except the 
		title bar)&nbsp; where a 
		<a href="ShrinkMenu.JPG">menu</a> will appear 
		giving the options of <b>Shrink </b>&amp; <b>Restore</b>. Additionally 
		the borders of the form may be resized as desired.</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li><u><font color="#FF0000"><b>Important Notices Please Read</b></font></u><ul>
		<li>When connecting to a amplifier remember that Flex radios
		<font color="#FF0000"><u><b>DO NOT</b></u></font> have any
		<font color="#FF0000"><b>ALC</b></font> control circuitry, 
		<font color="#800000"><b><i>yet!</i></b></font> It is up 
		to the operator to make sure the drive power level is adjusted properly 
		in <b>PowerSDR</b> or the amp may be over driven which could result in 
		distortion and/or the amp being damaged.</li>
		<li>Parallel ports can come up in any configuration when the pc is 
		booted up. My pc defaults to 4 (00000100) which equates to 30 meters 
		when it boots up. You could quite easily have your BCD device set to the 
		wrong band if caution is not exercised. It is a good policy to <b>not</b> turn on your BCD device until after
		<b>DDUtil</b> is up and running as the program will configure the port 
		based on what <b>transmit</b> frequency it receives from <b>PowerSDR</b>.</li>
		<li>In it's current state <b>PowerSDR</b> has a timer that will not allow 
		devices to connect to the CAT port if <b>PowerSDR</b> has been running for 
		10 
		minutes or more without a CAT connection. So if it fails to connect 
		(displays [not connected] in the title bar) close <b>PowerSDR</b> and restart it. 
		This will reset the CAT timer and <b>DDUtil</b> should now connect.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b><a name="Other"></a>Other Topics</b><ul>
		<li><b>BCD Data File Format</b><ul>
			<li>The BCD data file has a specific format that must be adhered to. The 
		frequency must be in multiples of 100 kHz (7000, 7100, 7200) due to the 
		way the BCD look up algorithm is constructed. The data itself can be any 
		decimal number from 0 - 255. An example setting 14,100 would be freq = 
		14100, data= 5 which equates to binary 00000101. </li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>BCD Data Port</b><ul>
			<li>Most BCD driven devices I have been associated with only use 3-5 
			control lines. My Quadra uses four (4). It is entirely conceivable 
			that two (2) BCD devices could be run off of one (1) port. Hook 
			device 1 to port pins 2-5 and device 2 to pins 6-9. Set up the data 
			file for say 20 meters using (14100, 85) instead of (14100, 5) and it 
			will produce 01010101 instead of 00000101 at the parallel port which 
			is a binary 5 for each device.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>Inter-Connecting Cables</b><ul>
			<li>Serial (RS-232) cables can be either purchased or fabricated by the 
		user as dictated by the device to be controlled.</li>
			<li>Parallel port cables will have to be fabricated by the user for the 
		particular hardware setup. I have prepared a sample cable
			<a href="Cables.pdf">drawing</a> as part of this package to 
		serve as a guide.</li>
			<li>If you would like to see how this concept works without setting up a 
		binary device you can build a small
		<a href="LEDs.pdf">LED</a> array that can connect to your parallel port 
		and show the binary code being sent.</li>
		You can watch the LEDs 
		change as the frequency changes.
		</ul></li>

<h2><u><font color="#800080"><a name="How"></a>How it works</font></font></u></h2>
<p><u><b>General</b></u></p>
<p>This software extends the users ability to control ancillary 
frequency sensitive devices such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Linear Power amplifiers with automatic band switching capabilities.</li>
	<li>Antenna switches using RS-232 or BCD input.</li>
	<li>SteppIR antenna controllers.</li>
	<li>Antenna tuners with automatic band switching capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Philosophy / Design Criteria</b></u></p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide a stand alone software program that will deliver <u><b>transmit</b></u> 
	frequency data, from <b>PowerSDR</b>, in the form of RS-232 serial data and/or BCD 
	parallel data to passive listener devices. <b>DDUtil</b> does not receive or 
	acknowledge any communication from the down stream devices it services. It 
	is a one way communication only. Hence, they are referred to as <i>Passive 
	Listeners</i>.</li>
	<li>It was also desired to use <b>DDUtil</b> with other radio 
	control programs simultaneously. Since most users run a logging program or 
	other radio control program, this was considered to be a very high priority.</li>
	<li>Use all current technologies, if appropriate, in the software design. 
	These include XML files, XPATH, Regular Expressions and Threading, to list a 
	few. Development was accomplished in the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Integrated Development Environment 
	(IDE).</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Program Flow</b></u></p>
<p>Upon program opening the following events occur:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Setup variables</li>
	<li>Restore saved values to form controls</li>
	<li>Initialize system polling timers for serial ports</li>
	<li>Open selected serial ports</li>
	<li>Show main form</li>
</ul>
<p>The program is driven by events from either the serial ports receiving data 
or the polling timers counting down and firing. The following descriptions 
describe these events.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Radio Port Data Received</b>
	<ul>
		<li>This indicates CAT data has arrived from <b>PowerSDR</b></li>
		<li>Decode <b>PowerSDR</b> data to see if it is frequency data</li>
		<li>If yes, send formatted frequency data to the selected passive 
		listener serial port and call BCD decoding routine to process and output 
		the BCD data on the selected parallel port</li>
		<li>If logger is active (log flag = true) send radio data to logger port</li>
		<li>Reset flags and return</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b>Logger Port Data Received</b>
	<ul>
		<li>This indicates CAT data has arrived from the logger/radio control 
		program</li>
		<li>Forward the command on to <b>PowerSDR</b> CAT port</li>
		<li>Disable the <b>PowerSDR</b> polling timer, which stops<b> DDUtil </b>querying the 
		radio for frequency data as this is now done by the logger program</li>
		<li>Set Log flag to true</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b>Logger Port Polling Timer Elapsed</b>
	<p>This indicates that logger port polling interval has expired which also 
	means that <b>NO</b> CAT data has arrived from the logger/radio control 
	program for 10 seconds</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Set radio poll timer to enabled</li>
		<li>Set the log flag to false</li>
		<li>Reset the logger polling timer (10 seconds)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b>Radio Port Polling Timer Elapsed</b>
	<p>This indicates the CAT port polling interval has expired which also means 
	the logger is not active</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Send CAT commands to <b>PowerSDR</b> for the VFO status and frequency</li>
		<li>Check <b>PowerSDR</b> CAT port buffer for messages</li>
		<li>Decode the buffer message data to see if it is frequency data</li>
		<li>If yes, send formatted frequency data to the selected passive 
		listener serial port and call BCD decoding routine to process and output 
		the BCD data on the selected parallel port</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
