The <b>Data Decoder</b> <b>Utility</b> <b>(DDUtil) </b>enables you to</font>:<ul>
	<li>Send transmit frequency data to RS-232 passive listener devices such as 
	SteppIR antenna controllers, linear amplifiers, antenna tuners and other 
	similar devices. This data is provided on the pc's serial communication port 
	commonly known as COMx.</li>
	<li>Send Binary Coded Data (BCD) to frequency sensitive devices based 
	on the <b>PowerSDR</b> <u><b>transmit</b></u> frequency. These devices can be, linear amplifiers, 
	antenna switches or any other similar device. This data is provided on the 
	pc's parallel port commonly known as LPTx.</li>
	<li>Build and maintain the BCD data file used by the parallel port without 
	having to use a separate program for creation/editing.</li>
	<li>Use the program by itself or with another radio control program such as 
	Ham Radio Deluxe (HRD), DXLab Commander, MixW if desired.</li>

<h2><u><font color="#800080"><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</font></font></u></h2>
<p>This program provides the 
	automation required to decode and present <b>transmit</b> frequency data to select 
frequency sensitive devices such as linear amplifiers, antenna controllers (SteppIR), 
antenna tuners, antenna band switchers, etc. <b>DDUtil</b> may be used in 
a stand-alone mode or with a radio control program such as DXLab Commander, Ham 
Radio Deluxe, Mix2W or any other radio control program that can use standard 
Kenwood CAT commands for communication with <b>PowerSDR</b>. <b>DDUtil</b> 
automatically senses when a radio control program is trying to communicate with 
<b>PowerSDR</b> and modifies it's mode of operation to allow for this, no user 
intervention is required. See the <a href="#How">&quot;How it Works&quot;</a> section for 
a more detailed description of program operation.<p>An XML file is used to 
provide the decoding reference data needed for the BCD output. A sample file is 
included with the distribution files to serve as a guide. This file may be 
created from scratch or modified from the sample provided and then saved with 
an appropriate user name. All file modification may be 
accomplished within the program or may be done in any XML file 
editor of the users choice. But, unless the user is familiar with XML file 
editing it is recommended that file modification be confined to <b>DDUtil</b> 
until proficiency is obtained. <p>The initial release is designed for the Flex 
family of radios including the SDR-1000 and Flex5000 series, but may well be 
extended to other radios in the future.<h2><u><font color="#800080"><a name="Instructions"></a>

	<h2><u><font color="#800080"><a name="Scenario"></a>Usage</font></u></h2>
<p>Using the <b>DDUtil</b> is straight forward and shouldn't require more than a 
minimal amount of familiarization for the user to be comfortable with it's use. </p>
<p>All control settings on the <b>DDUtil</b> forms are stored and remembered 
from session to session.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Hardware Setup</b><p>The following information is required to connect 
	<b>DDUtil </b>&nbsp;to your 
device(s).<ul>
		<li>What kind of device do you want to control (amplifier, antenna 
		switch, etc.).</li>
		<li>Is the device RS-232 or BCD driven.</li>
		<li>If RS-232 driven, set the device receiving the data to a Kenwood or 
		Yaesu model and speed to match 9600 8-N-1.</li>
		<li>If BCD driven, you must:<ul>
			<li>Know the BCD scheme (what codes do what) See the manufactures 
			user manual for this.</li>
			<li>Build a cable configured to fit your hardware setup (DB25M to 
			your device input port). See the hardware drawings for more 
			information.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Program Operation</b> - The following operations assume the proper 
	setups have been performed on the Ports and Device tab(s).<ul>
		<li> <b>DDUtil</b> as stand-alone.<ul>
			<li>Start <b>PowerSDR</b>, start <b>DDUtil</b>.</li>
			<li>If all is setup correctly you should see the frequency and VFO A in the header bar as [7,033.83] (VFO A/B). If instead you see 
			[not connected] there is a problem and some back tracking is in 
			order. The most common problem will be wrong port setup for <b>PowerSDR</b> (CAT) port or the CAT Polling Interval is way off, try 1000 
			for this setting.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li> <b>DDUtil</b> used with a radio control/logging program.<ul>
			<li>Start <b>PowerSDR</b>, start <b>DDUtil</b> and you should now 
			see connect data in the title bar that looks something like 
			[7,033.83] (VFO A). </li>
			<li>Start your radio control/logging program. If everything is 
			working right you should see something like [RC] [7,033.83] (VFO 
			A) in the title bar of <b>DDUtil</b> and your radio 
			control/logging program should show it has control of <b>PowerSDR</b>. 
			</li>
			<li><b>Note:</b>
			<p>The <b>[RC]</b> stands for Radio Control program is in use. If 
			the [RC] is not in the title bar the program is in <b>Stand-Alone</b> 
			mode.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><u><font color="#FF0000"><b>Important Notice:</b></font></u><ul>
		<li>In it's current state <b>PowerSDR</b> has a timer that will not allow 
		devices to connect to the CAT port if <b>PowerSDR</b> has been running for 3 
		minutes or more without a CAT connection. So if it fails to connect 
		(displays [not connected] in the title bar) close <b>PowerSDR</b> and restart it.</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b><a name="Other"></a>Other Topics</b><ul>
		<li><b>BCD Data File Format</b><ul>
		<li>The BCD data file has a specific format that must be adhered to. The 
		frequency must be in multiples of 100 khz (7000, 7100, 7200) due to the 
		way the BCD look up algorithm is constructed. The data itself can be any 
		decimal number from 0 - 255. An example setting 14,100 would be freq = 
		14100, data= 5 which equates to binary 00000101. </li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>BCD Data Port</b><ul>
			<li>Most BCD driven devices I have been associated with only use 3-5 
			control lines. My Quadra uses four (4). It is entirely conceivable 
			that two (2) BCD devices could be run off of one (1) port. Hook 
			device 1 to port pins 2-5 and device 2 to pins 6-9. Set up the data 
			file for say 20 meters using (14100, 85) instead of (14100, 5)and it 
			will produce 01010101 instead of 00000101 at the parallel port which 
			is a binary 5 for each device.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Hardware Setup</b><ul>
		<li>Serial (RS-232) cables can be either purchased or fabricated by the 
		user as dictated by the device to be controlled.</li>
		<li>Parallel port cables will have to be fabricated by the user for the 
		particular hardware setup. I have prepared a sample cable
		<a href="../docs/Cables.pdf">drawing</a> as part of this package to 
		serve as a guide.</li>

<h2><u><font color="#800080"><a name="How"></a>How it works</font></font></u></h2>
<p><u><b>General</b></u></p>
<p>The need for this software extends the users ability to control ancillary 
frequency sensitive devices such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Linear Power amplifiers with automatic band switching capabilities.</li>
	<li>Antenna switches using RS-232 or BCD input.</li>
	<li>SteppIR antenna controllers.</li>
	<li>Antenna tuners with automatic band switching capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Philosophy / Design Criteria</b></u></p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide a stand alone software program that will deliver <u><b>transmit</b></u> 
	frequency data, from <b>PowerSDR</b>, in the form of RS-232 serial data and/or BCD 
	parallel data to passive listener devices. <b>DDUtil</b> does not receive or 
	acknowledge any communication from the down stream devices it services. It 
	is a one way communication only. Hence, they are referred to as Passive 
	Listeners.</li>
	<li>It was also desired to be able to use <b>DDUtil</b> with other radio 
	control programs simultaneously. Since most users run a logging program or 
	other radio control program, this was considered to be a very high priority.</li>
	<li>Use all current technologies, if appropriate, in the software design. 
	These include XML files, XPATH, Regular Expressions and Threading, to list a 
	few. Development was accomplished in the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><b>Program Flow</b></u></p>
<p>Upon opening the following events occur:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Setup variables</li>
	<li>Restore saved values to form controls</li>
	<li>Initialize system polling timers for serial ports</li>
	<li>Open selected serial ports</li>
	<li>Show main form</li>
</ul>
<p>The program is driven by events from either the serial ports receiving data 
or the polling timers counting down and firing. The following descriptions 
describe these events.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Radio Port Data Received</b> 
	<ul>
		<li>This indicates CAT data has arrived from <b>PowerSDR</b></li>
		<li>Decode <b>PowerSDR</b> data to see if it is frequency data</li>
		<li>If yes, send formatted frequency data to the selected passive 
		listener serial port and call BCD decoding routine to process and output 
		the BCD data on the selected parallel port</li>
		<li>If logger is active (log flag = true) send radio data to logger port</li>
		<li>Reset flags and return</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Logger Port Data Received</b> 
	<ul>
		<li>This indicates CAT data has arrived from the logger/radio control 
		program</li>
		<li>Forward the command on to <b>PowerSDR</b> CAT port</li>
		<li>Disable the <b>PowerSDR</b> polling timer which disables querying of the 
		radio for frequency data as this is now done by the logger program</li>
		<li>Set Log flag to true</li>
		<li>Return</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Logger Port Polling Timer Elapsed</b> 
	<p>This indicates that logger port polling interval has expired which also 
	means that <b>NO</b> CAT data has arrived from the logger/radio control 
	program for 10 seconds</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Set radio poll timer to enabled</li>
		<li>Set the log flag to false</li>
		<li>Reset the logger polling timer (10 seconds)</li>
		<li>Return</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Radio Port Polling Timer Elapsed</b> 
	<p>This indicates the CAT port polling interval has expired which also means 
	the logger is not active</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Send CAT commands to <b>PowerSDR</b> for the VFO status and frequency</li>
		<li>Check <b>PowerSDR</b> CAT port buffer for messages</li>
		<li>Decode the buffer message data to see if it is frequency data</li>
		<li>If yes, send formatted frequency data to the selected passive 
		listener serial port and call BCD decoding routine to process and output 
		the BCD data on the selected parallel port</li>
		<li>Return</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
