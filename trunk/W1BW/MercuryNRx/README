MercuryNRx

This is a development version of suport for multiple simultaneous
receivers in Mercury.  This effort was begun by Kirk Weedman KD7IRS
and John Melton G0ORX/N6LYT in the fall of 2009.  I've also added
the memcic modules from Alex Shovkoplyas, VE3NEA.

The current version available for testing implements 4 receivers
which should be of similar or slightly better quality (in terms of
decimation filtering) than the Merc V2.9 single receiver.
