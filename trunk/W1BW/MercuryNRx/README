MercuryNRx

This is a development version of suport for multiple simultaneous
receivers in Mercury.  This effort was begun by Kerk Weedman KD7IRS
and John Melton G0ORX/N6LYT in the fall of 2009.

This code should be expected to be in an unstable and generally
non-working state while under development!
