This program has been compiled on Linux and Windows using the Qt 4.7.4 
and Qt Creator 2.3. Compiler availiable from http://qt.nokia.com/

Note that the adif-2.2.7.xml, Help directory and the svg files need 
to be in the same directory as the exicutable at the current time for 
the program to function correctly.
